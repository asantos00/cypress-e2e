- Why am I here today?
    - We write code, we test it, it works. QA tests it, it does not work.
    - But it worked on my computer!!!!

- Why? Lots of reasons, but that is not the why I'm answering today, I'm sorry.

- Actually this *why?* is for you. And I'll ask it again at the end of this talk.

- Let's start

- Present the application:
    - Little app to purchase tickets for the 3 big football clubs in Portugal
    - You can add and remove tickets from card, in the end you click buy
