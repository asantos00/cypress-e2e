# E2E tests with Cypress.io

From now on, no more excuses for your web app not to have E2E tests. Cypress enables you to write and run E2E tests with very few lines of code.

# Why?

You have developed (at least) a couple of web applications. You know that things always run on your computer, and you know they always fail on your QA's computer.

Why? Lots of reasons, sorry to disappoint but this is not the why I'm answering today.

This is the daily life of each one of us:

- We write code
- We write our tests
- Code seems to work
- We test our code manually
- We find a bug
- We test our code manually
- We test our code manually (just to grant we didn't break payment flow)
- You merge your branch
- **You broke payment flow!!!!!**

- It worked on your computer, your integration and unit tests were passing

Next time you'll spend more time testing the critical path (payment flow I'm looking at you) and you'll be more careful.

## But why?

Recruiting is hard, we are always refining the process so we can find better engineers. Good engineers solve problems, design solutions, colaborate, write code.

But let's be honest, engineers don't like to manually test stuff, at least **I don't**, and worst, **I suck at it!**.

And yes, I'm the one breaking the payment flow.

**Not anymore.**
