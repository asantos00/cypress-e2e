# E2E tests with Cypress.io

From now on, no more excuses for your web app not to have E2E tests. Cypress enables you to write and run E2E tests with very few lines of code.

# Why?

You have developed (at least) a couple of web applications. You know that things always run on your computer, and you know they always fail on your QA's computer. Why? Lots of reasons, sorry to disappoint but this is not the why I'm answering today.

This is the daily life of each one of us:

- We write code
- We write our tests
- Code seems to work
- We test our code manually
- We find a bug
- We test our code manually (just to grant we didn't break payment flow)
- You merge your branch
- **You broke checkout!!!!!**

- It worked on your computer, your integration and unit tests were passing
